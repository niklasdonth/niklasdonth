- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niklasdonth
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a PhD student and lecturer in Political Science at the University of Stuttgart. 
  I am deeply interested in how and why people form preferences and opinions in the political space and subsequently their votechoices.
  Furthermore, I have a keen interest in the strategic intersection between party and voter behaviour.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on growing as a scientist by learning and employing causal inference methods derived from the counterfactual causal model.
      Methodologically, I am also interested in the application of Bayesian statistics and Causal Maschine Learning Methods.
- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is via my mail niklas.donth@sowi.uni-stuttgart.de.
