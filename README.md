- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niklasdonth
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a PhD student and Lecturer in Political Science at the University of Stuttgart. 
  I am deeply interested in how and why people form preferences and opinions in the political space and their subsequent votechoices.
  Furthermore, I have a keen interest in the strategic intersection between party strategies and voter behaviour.
In my PhD project, I focus on the role of Left-Authoritarian voters in the electoral competition between Social Democracy and the Populist Radical Right in Europe.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on growing as a scientist by learning and employing causal inference methods derived from the counterfactual causal model.
      Methodologically, I am also interested in the application of Bayesian statistics and Causal Maschine Learning Methods.
